# TextSummarizer
''' This is an Natural Language Project which is can summarize a long article or paragraph into short summaries. It is a base level text summarizer which is developed using the traditional machine learning model `SVM`. A frontend will be created soon and the API can be a bit slow as it is deployed on render.
